What is Hypervisor?

    aka virtualization technology

    Virtualization Technology
        is a combination of Hardware and software solution Intel
        x86 (32 bit processors)
        x86 ( set of CPU 32-bit CPU Instructions - invented by Intel )
        x64 64-bit CPU Instructions is cross-licensed by Intel from AMD
        Virtualization Feature is called VT-X

    AMD
        x86 - Intel's 32 bit CPU Instructions are cross-licensed by AMD
        x64 (64-bit processors)
        x64 ( set of 64-bit CPU Instructions invented by AMD )
        Virtualization Feature is called AMD-V

    every processor that you find in market, pretty much supports Hypervisors

    Your Laptop/Desktop/Workstation/Server BIOS should also support Virtualization

    Make sure your Laptop BIOS settings shows up the Virtualization Feature Enabled

    Virtualization Softwares
        there are 2 types
            Type1
                meant for Workstations & Servers
                aka bare-metal hypervisors
                they don't need an OS to install this type of Hypervisor
            Type2
                meant to be used in Laptops/Desktops/Workstations
                it requires Host OS ( Windows, Mac OS-X, Linux )
                Type2 can only be installed on top of a Host OS
        VMWare
        VMWare Wokstation ( Linux, Mac OS-X & Windows ) - Type 2 - Hypervisor
        VMWare Player ( Windows ) - Type 2 Hypervisor
        VMWare vSphere/v-center ( Type 1 - Hypervisor )
        VMWare Fusion ( Mac OS-X) - Type 2
        Microsoft
            Hyper-v
        Oracle
            VirtualBox( Free for Personal & Commercial use )
        Parallels ( Mac OS-X)

Virtual Machine Overview?

    aka Guest OS
    each VM get's its own dedicated
        CPU Cores
        RAM
        Storage
        Virtual Network Card(s)
        Virtual Graphics Card(s)
    each VM has a fully functional Operating System
    has dedicated Kernel

Operating System within VM

    it has dedicated hardware resources
    it has dedicated Network/Graphics Card
    has one or more application processes
    has its own OS Kernel
    it supports command prompt in case of Windows, shell prompts ( bash, sh in case of Unix/Linux)

What is a Linux namespace?

    its an isolated virtual sandbox environment
    every container runs in its namespace
    every container has its own port namespace
    every container has its network namespace i.e a dedicated network stack (7 OSI Layers)

Container Technology

    is a software technology
    it is an application virtualization technology
    containers are nothing but application process
    containers are not Operating System
    containers shares the hardware resources available on the Host machine where containers are running
    each container - runs one single application

Container Image

    a blueprint of a container
    from developer point of view, Container Image is like a user-defined Class
    from a single container image, many containers can be created
    Example
        ubuntu:16.04
        centos:8
    the above images just have some shell like bash, sh, etc
    it comes file system ( files and folders )
    it comes with package manager ( apt-get/apt, yum, etc., )
    it has no Kernel or OS
    containers runs on top of some Operating System
    all containers that runs on the same system shares hardwares and os Kernel

Containers

    is an instance of Container Image
    from developer point of view, its an Object of some class

Docker Overview

    is a container software from Docker Inc
    is developed in Go programming language
    comes in 2 flavors
        Community Edition (CE) - opensource(Free)
        Enterprise Edition (EE) - Requires License/Commercial use
    follows client/server architecture
    client tool (docker)
    server tool (dockerd - application container engine/docker daemon)

Docker Registry

    has many Docker Images
    It is thru images one can create containers
    Three types
        Local Registry ( local folder where Docker Server is running )
        Private Registry ( Setup using Sonatype Nexus or JFrog Artifactory )
        Remote Registry ( Docker Hub Website maintained by Docker Inc )

JFrog Artifactory

    this server can be used multiple ways using its web interface
    can be used like a modern FTP Server that hosts application binaries
    application binaries can be download/uploaded manually/programatically
    also servers a repository server
        it can be setup within your organization as an Ubuntu apt repository server ( application installer )
        it can be setup within your organization as a CentOS/RHEL yum repository server
    as Private Container Registry
        you can host your Propriertary Container Images
        Your Private Images will have your application and its dependent libraries/fraweworks, etc

Ansible

    comes in two flavors
        Ansible Core (Command line interface only ) - OpenSource
        Ansible Tower ( RedHat Enterprise Product built on top of Ansible Core)
    configuration management tool like Puppet, Chef, Salt/SaltStack
    developed in Python by Ansible Inc organization
    it is used by DevOps Engineers to automate software installation, configuration management, etc.,
    use may provision containers locally, provision aws/azure ec2 instances
    the script that write is called Ansible Playbook ( YAML file )

Ansible Playbook

    can build a Custom Docker Image using Dockerfile you supply
    can provision a container with your Custom Image with basic tools pre-installed
    can install, configure the container post the container is provisioned
    can be used to provision a container locally or on cloud
    can be used to provision an ec2 instance

Custom Docker Image

    uses some exiting Docker Image as a base Image
    customize by installing additional software tools that you need for your specific applicaiton build/test/etc

Example

    let's say you have a spring-boot java application
    to compile this spring java application
        you need a build system( VM/Container/Ec2 Instance )
        the build machine must have the below
            Java Development Kit
            Ant/Maven/Gradle Build tool is required
            your application source code

CI/CD DevOps Pipeline

    when Java/C# application source code is committed into GitHub or similar version control
    Jenkins Job can be setup to monitor your application code repository within GitHub
    Jenkins Job constantly monitors for code changes committed in a particular code repo
    When Jenkins Job detects code changes, it can trigger an Ansible Playbook to provision the build machine
    the newly configured build system will be used to perform the application build
    As part of application build, it compilers, perform automated tests, package and the binaries will be deployed into JFrog Artifactory
    As part of the CI/CD pipeline, it is also possible to create custom Docker images from some base Docker Image, copying your application binaries into it along with its dependencies(lib)
    From the JFrog custom Docker Image you can deploy your containerized applications

Creating your first container

docker run hello-world:latest

(jegan@tektutor.org)$ docker run hello-world:latest

Hello from Docker!
This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.

To generate this message, Docker took the following steps:
 1. The Docker client contacted the Docker daemon.
 2. The Docker daemon pulled the "hello-world" image from the Docker Hub.
    (amd64)
 3. The Docker daemon created a new container from that image which runs the
    executable that produces the output you are currently reading.
 4. The Docker daemon streamed that output to the Docker client, which sent it
    to your terminal.

To try something more ambitious, you can run an Ubuntu container with:
 $ docker run -it ubuntu bash

To list the nginx container, you need to open another terminal tab as we launched nginx web server in interactive mode

docker ps

Find the IP address of the nginx container

docker inspect <nginx-container-id> | grep IPA
docker inspect <nginx-container-name> | grep IPA

Access the nginx web page

curl 172.17.0.3

In the above command, 172.17.0.3 is the nginx container IP, it might vary for you.
Deleting a container that is not running

docker rm <container-id>
docker rm <container-name>

Deleting a running container gracefully

docker stop <container-name>
docker rm <container-name>

Deleting a running container forcibly

docker rm -f <container-name>

Getting inside a running container

docker exec -it <container-name> /bin/bash

Some containers won't support bash, you may replace /bin/bash with /bin/sh in that case.
Deleting multiple exited containers

docker rm <container-name-1> <container-name-2> <container-name-3>

Deleting multiple exited containers without using their names

docker rm $(docker ps -aq)

Deleting all containers in your system forcibly

docker rm -f $(docker ps -aq)

Deleting all containers in your system gracefully

docker stop $(docker ps -q)
docker rm $(docker ps -aq)

Renaming a container

docker rename <old-container-name> <new-container-name>

Restarting a container

This might be useful, let's say you update some web server config file, etc., To apply config changes, you may have to reboot the container, in such cases this command comes in handy.

docker restart <container-name>

IP addresses of container are subject to change when they are either stop and started or restarted.
Creating 3 nginx web servers in background mode

docker run -d --name web1 --hostname web1 nginx:latest
docker run -d --name web2 --hostname web2 nginx:latest
docker run -d --name web3 --hostname web3 nginx:latest

Finding the IP Addresses of web1, web2 and web3 respectively

docker inspect -f {{.NetworkSettings.IPAddress}} web1
docker inspect -f {{.NetworkSettings.IPAddress}} web2
docker inspect -f {{.NetworkSettings.IPAddress}} web3

Accessing web1, web2 and web3 container nginx pages

curl <web1-container-ip>
curl <web2-container-ip>
curl <web3-container-ip>

Deleting an image from local docker registry

docker rmi hello-world:latest

Volume Mounting - storging mysql db and table recorded in an external storage

Load Balancer example

docker run -d --name web1 --hostname web1 nginx:latest
docker run -d --name web2 --hostname web2 nginx:latest
docker run -d --name web3 --hostname web3 nginx:latest

docker run -d --name lb --hostname lb -p 80:80 nginx:latest

The port on the left represents host machine where the container is running. The port on the right side represents the container port where nginx is listening.

List the containers and see if all containers are in running state

docker ps

We need to copy the nginx.conf from lb container to our local machine to configure it as Load Balancer

docker cp lb:/etc/nginx/nginx.conf .

Update the nginx.conf file locally with the below content

user  nginx;
worker_processes  auto;

error_log  /var/log/nginx/error.log notice;
pid        /var/run/nginx.pid;


events {
    worker_connections  1024;
}

http {
    upstream backend {
        server 172.17.0.2:80;
        server 172.17.0.3:80;
        server 172.17.0.4:80;
    }
    
    server {
        location / {
            proxy_pass http://backend;
        }
    }
}

Find your web1, web2 and web3 container IPs

docker inspect -f {{.NetworkSettings.IPAddress}} web1
docker inspect -f {{.NetworkSettings.IPAddress}} web2
docker inspect -f {{.NetworkSettings.IPAddress}} web3

In the above file, you need to replace the IPs with your web1, web2 and web3 IP addresses respectively.

172.17.0.2 - nginx web server 1
172.17.0.3 - nginx web server 2
172.17.0.4 - nginx web server 3

Copy the nginx.conf file from local machine to lb container

docker cp nginx.conf lb:/etc/nginx/nginx.conf

Restart the lb container to apply config changes

docker restart lb

Verify if the lb container is still running after restart

docker ps

Let's configure the web1, web2 and web3 index.html to identify which web server is serving us(Optional)

echo "Server 1" > index.html
docker cp index.html web1:/usr/share/nginx/html/index.html

echo "Server 2" > index.html
docker cp index.html web2:/usr/share/nginx/html/index.html

echo "Server 3" > index.html
docker cp index.html web3:/usr/share/nginx/html/index.html

Let's test the lb

curl http://localhost:80

If the above curl is not updating the output in round-robin fashion, try localhost from RPS lab machine web browser
